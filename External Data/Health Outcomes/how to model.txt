From this page: https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showFullMetadataReport.action?id=8B06C303-F945-4170-AB4A-2B23F0C3425D, it appears that the data for the previous year becomes available in July of the next year. So since we have data through 2016, that data would become available in July 2017. Therefore if we could see how data up through 2016 predicts health outcomes in 2018, that would be helpful.
