		    		    	<li><p>Data obtained from NLCD (National Land Cover Database) provided by U.S. Department of the Interior, Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium. Gridded data were also available from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mrlc.gov/finddata.php">Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium</a>.</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Agriculture includes the combination of Pasture/Hay and Cultivated Crop Land Use in NLCD gridded data (see definition at <a href="https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php" target="_blank">https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php</a>).</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Percentages for each county were estimated as proportion of grids classified as "Agricultural Land Use" among all grids wthin the county.</p></li>

            <h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
        <p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

            <h3>Data Differences</h3>
        <p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

  <h3>Why was the data set created?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Purpose</p></b>
	<p><p><strong>Measures 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Allow for comparison across states and counties; such comparison can be used to target interventions.</p><p>Identify communities at risk and the percentage of population which may be vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Measures 3 &amp; 4:</strong> Use to visualize the classification of urban/rural counties scheme.</p></p>
  </div>
  <h3>How was the data set created?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Derivation of measure</p></b>
	<p><p><strong>Measures 1 &amp; 2:</strong> These measures were derived from the 2001, 2006, and 2011 Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium National Land Cover Database (<a href="https://www.mrlc.gov/finddata.php">https://www.mrlc.gov/finddata.php</a>). The NLCD land cover estimates are a grid of 30m x 30m pixels, each categorized as one of 20 land cover categories meeting different criteria of interest. For each state, county and census tract, the percentage of the area covered by developed land (open space, low, medium or high intensity) and agriculture (i.e., pasture/hay or cultivated crops), individually, were calculated using GIS software.</p><p><strong>Measures 3 &amp; 4:</strong> National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data systems are often used to study the associations between urbanization level of residence and health and to monitor the health of urban and rural residents. NCHS has developed a six-level urban-rural classification scheme for U.S. counties and county-equivalent entities. The most urban category consists of "central" counties of large metropolitan areas and the most rural category consists of nonmetropolitan "noncore" counties.(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm</a>).</p></p>

  <h3>What are the limitations of the data set?</h3>
  <div>
  	<b><p></p></b>
	<p><p><strong>Measures 1 &amp; 2:</strong></p><p>MRLC National Land Cover Database (NLCD):</p><ul><li>NLCD data are updated every 5 years, with some lag for when the update is released, so the data do not necessarily represent current conditions on the pixel-scale.</li><li>NLCD products are intended for use in identifying regional landscape patterns and major functional habitats.</li><li>Small features and changes should be verified with a higher resolution data source.</li></ul><p><strong>Measures 3 &amp; 4:</strong></p><p>NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties:</p><ul><li>The NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties should only be used with data files where all counties are identified.</li><li>Changes in the classification of counties that result when urbanization schemes are updated ensure that current settlement patterns are represented, but they can make comparison of statistics computed using different versions of the scheme problematic.</li><li>Review <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_166.pdf">2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_154.pdf">2006 and 1990 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties</a> for information regarding any additional limitations and conclusions for the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification data.</li></ul></p>

  <h3>How should these data be used?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Use Constraints</p></b>
	<p><p><strong>Measures 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Measures are listed individually but also may be appropriate for use in combination such as in a Heat Vulnerability Index (Reid et al 2009).</p><p>Some measures presented at the county level may be more informative at a lower geography, such as census tract.</p><p><strong>Measures 3 &amp; 4:</strong></p><ul><li>Changes in the classification of counties that result when urbanization schemes are updated ensure that current settlement patterns are represented, but they can make comparison of statistics computed using different versions of the scheme problematic</li><li>Review <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_166.pdf">2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_154.pdf">2006 and 1990 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties</a> for information regarding any additional limitations and conclusions for the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification data.</li></ul></p>
